== Usage

AMarshal is similar to Marshal.

  % ruby -ramarshal -e 'AMarshal.dump([1,2,3], STDOUT)'
  v = []
  v[0] = Array.allocate()
  v[0] << 1
  v[0] << 2
  v[0] << 3
  v[0]

Highly experimental pretty printing version also exists:

  % ruby -ramarshal-pretty -e '
    o = [1,2]
    o << [[3], [[4]], [[[o]]]]
    o = [5, o, [[[o]]], o]
    AMarshal.dump_pretty(o, STDOUT)'
  v = []
  v[0] = Array.allocate
  v[0] << 1
  v[0] << 2
  v[0] << [[3], [[4]], [[[v[0]]]]]
  [5, v[0], [[[v[0]]]], v[0]]
